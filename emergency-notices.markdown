Officials continue water response efforts, urge residents to follow emergency usage restrictions

A boil water notice and emergency conservation are in place for a fifth day for all Austin Water customers.

The Austin-Travis County Emergency Operations Center remains activated and continues to work with staff from Austin Water, the Lower Colorado River Authority, and the State of Texas to monitor water conditions and the situation at the Highland Lakes.

As a result of prolonged flooding and the city-wide boil water notice, Mayor Steve Adler issued a Local State of Disaster, which will assist in the City's recovery phase and in seeking reimbursement from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

With no rain in the forecast and floodwaters slowing, water quality in the lakes is improving—settling debris, silt and mud — and allowing water plants to treat more water. The water treatment system is strengthening thanks to the reductions in water use by the Austin community and improving raw water quality. Storage water reservoirs are at about 50% storage and are continuing to climb. More water testing and monitoring will still be done but the reductions in water use by the Austin community have helped Austin Water make gains and better stabilize the water treatment system.

The public is still being asked to avoid water usage that is not completely necessary:

Avoid all outdoor water use and minimize indoor use immediately.
Not use water for irrigation or testing of irrigation equipment
Not wash vehicles, including at commercial car wash facilities
Not wash pavement or other surfaces
Not add water to a pool or spa
Not conduct foundation watering
Don’t operate an ornamental fountain or pond, other than aeration necessary to support aquatic life
Emergency water conservation is still in place and the public is still being asked to avoid water use that is not completely necessary into the weekend. Any water used for drinking or cooking should be brought to a vigorous, rolling boil for three minutes. In lieu of boiling water, residents may use bottled water. Public water distribution sites continue to operate from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. and are located at:

Walnut Creek Park (12138 N Lamar Blvd)
City of Austin Warehouse, formerly Home Depot (7211 N IH 35 SVRD NB)
Roy G. Guerrero Park (400 Grove Blvd)
Onion Creek Soccer Complex (5600 E William Cannon Dr)
Dick Nichols Park (8011 Beckett Rd)
Kelley Reeves Athletic Complex (10211 W. Parmer Ln) **closes 5 p.m. on Friday**
Circuit of the Americas (9201 Circuit of the Americas Blvd)
Pick up will be located at the driveway entrance of the sites. Supplies are limited to one gallon of water per person and up to four gallons for a family of four. City of Austin volunteers will be staffing the water distribution sites. Pick up will be located at the driveway entrance of the sites. As of 4 p.m., all seven sites served a combined 9,050 drive thru vehicles and gave a total of 74,449 gallons.

With the increased use of bottles water, the City asks residents to recycle all single-use plastic bottles and jugs instead of throwing them in the trash. Those with limited, inconvenient or of lack of access to recycling can drop off plastic bottles, containers and film and the Recycle & Reuse Drop-Off Center located at 2514 Business Center Drive.

Emma Long Park has reopened.

The following city facilities and parks remain closed:

Bartholomew Pool
Springwoods Pool
Red Bud Isle and Red Bud Trail
Butler/Liz Carpenter fountains
Barton Springs Pool
Walsh Boat Landing
Boating concessions on Lady Bird Lake
Water fountains throughout park system
A waterway ban for Lake Austin and Lake Travis is still in effect and will be reevaluated on Monday, Oct. 29.

LCRA has indicated Lake Buchanan has reopened. Lakes Inks, LBJ, Marble Falls and Travis will remain closed until at least Tuesday, Oct. 30.

Austin Public Health staff has worked with restaurant partners to identify alternative approaches to hand washing and dish washing practices that are equally safe. These alternatives procedures are endorsed by the Austin Health Authority and are consistent with best practices advised by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control:

Commercial dishwashers providing a hot water rinse (165°F - 180°F) or a chemical sanitizing cycle may be used. Machines must be properly maintained and operated as required by Texas Food Establishment Rules. Air-dry all wares after sanitizing.
All food handlers handling or preparing foods are required to wash hands (using existing water sources) as required by the Texas Food Establishment Rules, then apply an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, followed by the donning of single use (disposable) gloves. No bare-hand contact with ready-to-eat foods is allowed.
As a preemptive measure, Austin Water issued a self-imposed, city-wide boil water notice on the morning of Monday, Oct. 22, advising customers to boil water before use. On Tuesday, October 23, Austin Water experienced a brief spike in turbidity levels which triggered an official mandatory boil water notification, as required by state law, and has notified its customers. The spike in turbidity does not require any change to precautionary measures already in place and does not put the public at additional risk.
